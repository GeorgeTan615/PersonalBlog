## Introduction
Hello! My name is George, I'm soon to be 23 years old and I'm currently a Software Engineer working in a small-sized quant research firm. It's been some time since I've wanted to start a personal website/blog to document stuff in my life, and finally here it is!

I'll try my best to keep the site updated daily with new stuff I want to share, mainly revolving around topics like tech, finance, and life in general. 

## Inspiration
Few months ago, a friend of mine from my last company told me about his daily blog site where he writes down random stuff everyday. He encouraged me to get into it as well and here I am.

Not only would I be able to document things down, I think this will also serve as a great platform to share new stuff I've learnt everyday. You know what they say,
> You learn best when you explain it to others, and if you can't explain it well enough to others, it means you don't understand it enough.
