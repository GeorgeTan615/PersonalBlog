description: How I'm able to shut down from work better nowadays

It's been a while since I've written, things have been quite hectic for me, but the idea for this post bubbled up 💭 in my mind when I was showering earlier and I thought it would be interesting to share.

If you know me well, you would know that I have **trouble _"shutting down"_ from work**, meaning that I struggle to stop thinking about work matters. Even when I was working at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/about/) previously, I often found myself working way past normal working hours, not because someone demanded me to, but because I could just simply not "shut down" from work.

At that time, I even asked a few of my colleagues how they would manage this and separate their 9-5 from their 5-9. Some suggested having **separate phones**📱, one for work and one for personal usage; Some suggested having **occasions/activities**🏃 planned out to keep you occupied; Some suggested just trying to **have peace of mind**💆‍♂️ to keep things slow.

So far, I've improved greatly in shutting down from work. I don't have a company laptop for my current company, instead, I have a desktop setup in the office. Although this means that my working arrangement is fully in the office, I'm able to **completely forget about work when I get home**! This has provided me great ease of mind so far, even if I still think about work, I can't get any done anyways, so eventually, the thought about work would just fade off 😂. I've also been trying to venture into more things other than tech/work and this has also shifted my focus to other areas, which is kinda refreshing.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to deprioritize work, I just believe that my 5-9 after my 9-5 is essential to maintain a healthy mental well-being and prevent myself from getting burnt out easily. Hope everything plays out smoothly and wish whoever is reading this now the best of luck in whatever you're doing!
