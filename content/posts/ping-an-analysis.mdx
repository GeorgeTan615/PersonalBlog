# What is Ping An Insurance Group (2318)?

Ping An is one of the top insurance companies in China, alongside other insurance companies like `The People’s Insurance Company`, `China Pacific Insurance Group`, `China Life Insurance`, and `China United Insurance Group`. 

Ping An started as just a property and casualty insurance company, later on expanding into life and health insurance, banking, asset management, technology, etc.

Ping An is also listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol `2318` and is also a Fortune 500 company.

# Ping An Business Breakdown

## Life and Health (L&H)

As the name suggests, this is the business line that covers life and health insurance products, which includes coverage for things like sudden death, medical costs, etc.

Ping An also continuously diversifies and upgrades its products to provide more comprehensive products. By leveraging their health and care ecosystem, they also package their insurance along with other services to provide more comprehensive/one-stop solutions. 

These products include:

1. Developments in Insurance Protection
    - More comprehensive coverage for critical/non-critical illness, also covering wealth management and meeting customer’s multi-protection needs.

    - Launching an upgraded version for the pension market for an extended age limit of enrollment and more flexible ways to receive pension benefits. This is to cater to the longer life expectancy of people in China.

### Channels

Ping An also has a few channels to reach customers:

1. Agent
    - The classic way is agents approaching people and signing them up.
    - The good thing about Ping An is they focus on the quality of agents, they shave off underperforming ones and recruit new better quality ones, often through referral from the existing high-performing ones.    
    - Based on their reports, agents seem to be bringing more and more value to the table.

2. Bancassurance
    - Basically through the cooperation with banks and leveraging off banks’ customers to get Ping An’s package.
3. Community Grid and other channels
    - Honestly, I don’t understand this enough to comment.

### Operating & Net Profit

L&H had a 1.3% YoY growth for operating profits and 12.7% YoY growth for net profits.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%201.png)

### Persistency Ratio

Persistency ratio refers to the number of total policies an insurer has renewed or in-force policies.  So far it has been going well for Ping An and this shows that people are still actively involved in Ping An’s insurance.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%202.png)

### Solvency Margin

Solvency margin means the excess capital a company must hold over and above the claim amounts they are likely to incur.

The solvency margin has to be at least `100%` and generally `≥` `150%` is healthy. Ping An well exceeds this at `208.8%`(looking at actual capital), so no worries that Ping An can’t pay your claims.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%203.png)

### New/Renewed Policies

There has been a drop in the new business, but I think it makes sense since there was a slight drop (`-2%`) in number of agents as well. 

Renewal business is doing great and this is a good sign too as what we ultimately want to see is consistent cash flows down the years from renewals and premiums gained.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%204.png)

The lapse rate also tells us that there are more renewals than before.

## Property and Casualty (P&C)

Ping An has another insurance line for property and casualty. This covers auto, corporate property and casualty, engineering, cargo, liability, guarantee, credit, home contents, accident and health, and international reinsurance.

### Product Types

1. Auto 
    - All things related to automotive. Services, claims, accidents, autonomous driving, etc.
    - Ping An also has an app called `Ping An Auto Owner` app, which makes things super convenient. It can accurately match each insurance claim with databases covering vehicles, auto parts, repair facilities, and costs for services. In a matter of seconds, insurance companies can determine the appropriate damages to be paid out, reducing costs related to claims process inefficiencies and the risk of insurance fraud. The solution integrates third-party services, including towing, parts providers, and claims adjusters. It's a one-stop solution for insurance, services, emergency assistance, annual inspection, etc.
    - The app also has over 150 million registered users as of December 31, 2021, including more than 37 million active users each month. More than 95 million vehicles have been linked with the app.
2. Liabilities
    - Liability insurance protects against claims resulting from injuries or damage to other people or property. Liability insurance provides a payout to the third party and not the policyholder.
3. Corporate Property and Casualty
    - Targeted to businesses to cover common business risks (e.g. damage, theft).
4. Agricultural
    - Mostly targeted to farmers to insure against various environmental risks like weather.
    - Ping An integrates technology for this, such as having `Ai Nong Bao` online platform for self-service claims and payments. There’s also technology for remote sensing (e.g. satellite imagery) and meteorological detection (e.g. weather/climate monitoring and forecasting) to help farmers claim their settlement for agricultural insurance.
    - More about how Ping An uses remote sensing in its business [here](https://group.pingan.com/media/news/2022/successful-launch-of-pingan-3-satellite-empowers-inclusive-finance.html).

### Profits

Overall profits look good and are increasing YoY.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%206.png)

### Solvency Margin

Amazing solvency margins as well, proving they are well capable of paying claims.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%207.png)

## Insurance Funds Investment

This is the line of business where Ping An takes the investable funds gained from their L&H and P&C insurance business and invests in the markets.

### Portfolio Breakdown

Ping An holds a portfolio of nearly `RMB5.20 trillion` as of June 30, 2024, and has grown over `10%` YTD.

Most of it is in bonds, and each other categories take no more than 5% except for stocks. 

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%208.png)

### Investment Income

Investment income seems to be healthy and recovering as well, `16.2%` increase YTD, with an annualized investment yield of `4.2%`.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%209.png)

## Banking

Ping An’s banking business is carried out via Ping An Bank. It has various businesses like:

1. Retail business
    - Retail loans, e.g. car loans, mortgage loans, etc.
    - Deposits and wealth management.
    - Debit cards, credit cards.
2. Corporate businesses
    - Corporate loans, e.g. manufacturing, energy, real estate, infrastructure, public utilities, etc.
3. Interbank business
    - Currency trading between banks facilitates internal trade and investments comprising different currencies.
    - Support corporate customer’s financial needs, e.g. spot and derivative foreign exchange hedging.

### Profits

Ping An’s revenue had an obvious drop of `13%`, the reason is as quoted:

> Mainly due to ongoing support for the real economy and the adjusted asset portfolio.
> 

Despite that, we still do see higher net profits with an increase of `1.9%`. This is possible due to the large decrease in impairment losses compared to last year.

## Asset Management

Ping An asset management is entrusted with the company's insurance funds, most of the assets are the insurance funds.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2011.png)

Ping An asset management is also involved in other businesses like:

1. Securities Business
    1. Securities brokerage, futures brokerage, investment banking, and financial advisory through Ping An Securities and its subsidiaries.
2. Trust Business
    1. Like family trusts and insurance trusts.
        1. Family trust: A trust established to manage and distribute family assets based on the grantor’s wish.
        2. Insurance trust: Grantors can decide how and when the insurance payouts are received, ensuring the funds are used as they wish. Structured distributions can also help the receivers better manage the large lump sum payout to ensure the funds are well used. 
3. Financial Leasing business.

## Technology

### Lufax

Provide financial services for small business owners. If not mistaken, its

Lufax’s financials tanked and is the main contributor on why the Technology business has much lesser net profit year on year. Lufax reduced its lending business in the first half of
2024. As a result, total income decreased `33.1%` year on year to `RMB12,940 million`. Moreover, tax expenses increased due to a special dividend paid by Lufax Holding. As a result, net loss amounted to `RMB1,663 million` in the first half of 2024.

### OneConnect

Provides technology as a service for the financial services industry. However, OneConnect will shut down its cloud services from July 2024 onwards, but this will not affect Ping An’s operations.

> With a profound understanding of Ping An Group’s business needs gained by the Group over the years as well as extensive expertise in the financial services industry and regulatory environment in which Ping An Group operates, the Group has been developing and offering comprehensive and tailored technology solutions that address the needs and improve the operational efficiency of Ping An Group. The Company’s strategic business relationship with Ping An Group remains unchanged.

### Ping An Health / Ping An Good Doctor

One-stop solution for health and senior care services which we talked about in the L&H section.

Revenues and gross profit decreased year on year but were profitable. The reason for the drop is as follows, quote Ping An Good Doctor’s 2024 interim report:

> This was mainly attributable to changes in the model of certain business lines leading to delays in revenue recognition in the first half of 2024, as well as a high base in the first half of 2023 (ongoing realignment of the Company’s business with low strategic synergies and contract fulfillment concentrated in the first half of 2023 due to some one-off factor).
> 

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2014.png)

They were also profitable compared to last year, but this was mainly due to the reduced expenses, such as marketing, admin, and r&d.

### Autohome

Provides a comprehensive auto ecosystem, gets reviews of cars, purchases second-hand cars, schedules test drives, and many more features. [https://www.autohome.com.cn/beijing/](https://www.autohome.com.cn/beijing/) Honestly too much stuff to cover one by one.

Daily active users increased `8.3%` year on year to `67.91` million in June 2024.

Financials look great too.

# Financials

### Income Statement

Overall net profit increases year on year

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2020.png)

### Balance Sheet

Assets also increased, and so did liabilities but assets still more

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2021.png)

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2022.png)

### Cash flow statement

Cash flow looks fine as well. It has way more cash flow from operating activities compared to before. More money is being thrown back to purchase property, equipment, and investments too.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/image%2023.png)

### Historical Net Profits

Looking back at net profits for previous years and comparing EPS.

![image.png](/ping-an-analysis/table.jpg)

Judging how results in 6 months ending June 2024 are much better compared to 2023, we should have a high chance of ending the 2024 Annual Report with better results. 6 months ending June net profits is also at highs in the last 5 years. Looks good.

### Cash generation

Cash generated from operating activities was at the highs in the 6 months ended June 2022 at RMB 312,030 million. We are on track to recover this number as well at currently RMB 304,883 million. Since the company is bringing in healthy cash flows, this is a good sign that it is recovering healthily. 

# Reasons Ping An Dropped

Ping An had several drops in 2021, 2023, and 2024.

### 2021 China Fortune Land Issue

Ping An had around 54 billion yuan exposure to China Fortune Land and the stock price dropped `50%`, while real estate exposure is only `4+%`, with no signs of over-leveraging, the market seems to be over-worried. If not mistaken, China Fortune Land had debt-paying issues, this could be related to how real-estate developers in China are over-leveraged.

### 2023 Property market slump

Over leveraging. Borrow money to acquire land, sell it, take the cash proceeds, and use it to fund the next project, before the first batch of buildings has been completely built. It's just like a Ponzi scheme. 

Companies like Evergrande and Country Garden are affected. Evergrande was once China’s largest developer before it got a court-ordered liquidation in Hong Kong in January 2024. Country Garden is now the biggest operating developer.

Ping An does not have exposure in Evergrande, but it has for Country Garden. However, it has already sold all shares as [reported](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ping-an-exited-its-country-garden-stake-has-no-takeover-plan-bloomberg-news-2023-11-08/#:~:text=Nov%208%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Ping,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter.) on November 8, 2023, I believe this is one of its strategies to reassess its investment thesis on the real estate sector, so I think we can feel a little safer for Ping An’s condition along with China’s housing market fluctuations. 

Ping An made a $20 billion loss in asset management in 2023. It is stated to be affected by:

1. In the macroeconomic environment, some assets came under pressure due to rising credit risks and volatile capital markets in 2023. 
2. Market volatility in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese stocks as well as provisions made to "certain projects" resulted in a net loss in the asset management sector. 
3. Market declines and volatility [in China and Hong Kong] have had a relatively big impact on the whole finance industry, including the insurers

### 2024 Price Drop

Not sure why the price dropped in May 2024. Prices did reach a resistance level of around `46-47`.

# Why hasn't Ping An recovered?

Ping An was largely affected by the property scene in China throughout these last few years. But Ping An was already on track to recover since starting of January 2024 based on the share price. Judging from Ping An’s strong finances as we have covered in the previous sections, we should be able to see Ping An recover soon. 

# Worst Case Scenarios

I think in terms of financials, Ping An is well covered. Asset, profits, and cash are increasing readily, and core businesses like L&H, P&C, and Banking are all still doing well.

In my opinion, what is to be worried about is the property outlook in China and if it worsens, how it would affect China as a whole. Macro influences in China would largely affect Ping An’s stock price too.

# Key Valuation Metrics

### Price-Book (PB)

Ping An has a price-to-book ratio of `0.66` as reported by Yahoo Finance, which is low as companies should generally have a price-to-book of at least `1`. It doesn’t make sense for a company to be valued less than the assets it has, thus Ping An is severely undervalued based on these metrics.

### Price-Earnings (PE)

Ping An has a PE ratio of `7.10` as reported by Yahoo Finance. PE ratios are harder to gauge whats an optimal value, compared to PB ratio which has a logical number of `1`. Referencing an article [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-average-pricetoearnings-ratio-insurance-sector.asp), insurance companies with positive earnings usually have around `12.99` PE, indicating that Ping An is undervalued now.

### Return-On-Equity (ROE)

Ping An has an annualized ROE of `16.4%`, which is rather healthy, this shows the efficiency of Ping An making profits off its net assets.

Just for reference here, generally PB ratio of less than 1 and ROE of more than 10 is a good buy. Other insurance giants like Prudential and AIA have PB ratios of `1.35` and `1.86` respectively, and ROE of `7.56%` and `15.3%` respectively. Ping An is much undervalued compared to these companies, with a lower PB ratio and higher ROE.

# Entry and Exit plan

## Entry

`30` zones seem to be a possible buy. Perhaps start entering the first batch at current levels around `35`. Levels like `32.55` and `30` would be good buying areas too, but not sure if we would reach those areas again.

## Exit

Considering some of the key metrics we observed, assuming Ping An’s net assets don't change and the number of shares does not decrease, Ping An has a `34%` upside to reach a PB ratio of `1`. This aligns with a key resistance level of `46-47`.

Considering if Ping An could reach up to `1.5` PB ratio, it would indicate a more than `100%` growth in share price. A key resistance level of `70` would roughly bring us `100%` profits too.

TP1: `46-47` (`30+%`)

TP2: `70` (~`100%`)

# Conclusion

I think Ping An is still at a solid position as one of the top insurance companies in China. Despite seeing a drop in performance in the banking and technology business, Ping An’s core business of insurance and asset management is still doing great, and these two are the main drivers for Ping An’s overall performance. 

Retail customers are increasing, lapse rate is decreasing, customers are renewing, this shows the trust for Ping An is undisrupted. Big and reputable insurance companies like Ping An also have a strong economic moat, customers are unlikely to sign with another insurance companies that are smaller in scale / hasn’t been around as long as Ping An did (since 1988). 

Investment income is also increasing year-on-year. Ping An also does not have huge exposure in real-estate, so even if the property market goes further down, it would only be mainly affected by the macroeconomics of things, and not bring the overall income down. 

Ping An also seems very undervalued, a company with such strong economic moat (reputation, history, service) and strong financials, but its only trading at a PB ratio of `< 1` . Ping An also offers a `7+%` dividend yield based off current price levels.  In my opinion, Ping An seems like a bargain and its a `good buy` , offering decent capital gains and dividend yield.
