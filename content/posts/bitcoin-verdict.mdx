Bitcoin has been quite a hot topic lately, especially in 2024 due to the [halving event](https://www.ey.com/en_ch/blockchain/the-bitcoin-halving-explained#:~:text=After%20every%20210%2C000%20blocks%20that,effectively%20designed%20to%20control%20inflation.), which is expected to be around mid-April.

Let's go through some common worries and why I think Bitcoin could have good value. **Disclaimer**, not financial advice and I genuinely don't know what I'm talking about ðŸ«£.

## Worries
### 1. Cryptocurrency is not widely accepted as a medium of payment yet
Crypto prices are highly volatile, merchants donâ€™t want to risk losing value in their payment medium when there are price swings.

Crypto has yet to be fully regulated, meaning it is not backed by any governments or regulatory authorities, crypto could even be banned one day and all things would go south. However, I tend to believe this is quite unlikely as we can see that cryptocurrencies are not going away.
- [Bitcoin Spot ETF approved](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023). This allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding Bitcoin themselves.
- [Renowned companies like PayPal moving towards enabling cryptocurrency payments](https://www.barrons.com/articles/paypal-crypto-payments-apple-competition-51654628762).
- Cryptocurrencies have been around since 2009, but it has yet to be banned. Why? We will talk more about how cryptocurrencies and blockchain disrupt governments and banks, but if this technology indeed threatens the governments and banks, why haven't they banned it yet ðŸ‘€? On the other side,  things like Crypto Spot ETF could still be approved by the SEC ðŸ¤”? It sounds to me like crypto is here to stay.
- Useful article [here](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/27/the-case-for-regulating-not-banning-crypto/#:~:text=The%20SEC%27s%20authority%20here%2C%20by,one%20by%20one%2C%20in%20court) on regulation as well.

### 2. Government and Banks dislike crypto
Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and transparent, banks are the exact opposite. If crypto is normalized in the future, it will disrupt traditional finance and impact the centralized parties. If crypto is a norm, banks might be put out of business as we technically do not even need a bank anymore in the future.
- We have full control of our own money.
- We send money without going through banks.
- We don't have to wait for a few business days to send money to any part of the world, unlike wire transfers. 

Not everyone has access to banks, and not everyone has a rather less volatile valued currency on their hands, cryptocurrency solves these.

Despite the disruption, some countries are [accepting cryptocurrencies as a method of payment](https://www.investopedia.com/el-salvador-accepts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-5200470). There is a possibility that central banks or governments might issue their version of stablecoins which are tied to certain currencies, as the US Fed is exploring CDBCs. In my opinion, this remains a huge mystery on what is the ideal way to go about this.

But back to some points I addressed in Worry #1, I can't help to think, 
> If this technology indeed threatens governments and banks, why haven't they banned it yet ðŸ‘€? On the other side, things like Crypto Spot ETF could still be approved by the SEC ðŸ¤”?

### 3. Bitcoin can be easily replaced by Bitcoin forks or other Altcoins
When this fact is brought up, most people are thinking from the utility perspective. It's very possible to create another blockchain protocol that has the same features as Bitcoin ([Bitcoin Tech](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)), or even a superset of it, and this would overtake Bitcoin, or maybe not? I would argue that this is partially true.

Take Instagram for example, if someone created an Instagram clone with more features, from a utility perspective it might be better, but it has to be attractive enough to start using it to gain adoption. If the added extra utility is that mindblowing, the real platform itself could implement it themselves too. Just like how Instagram added the stories features after Snapchat did so.

These are sort of like **"hard"** aspects, there are certain **"soft"** aspects that arenâ€™t considered in this debate, such as first mover advantage, network effects, strong security, and strong store of value. Bitcoinâ€™s core value lies in it being a store of value, this requires time for it to be evident, and over the years Bitcoin has indeed proved that it's a great store of value, as well as having great security (thanks to [Proof-of-work consensus algorithm](https://blockworks.co/news/what-is-proof-of-work)).
> The marketâ€™s trust in the security, durability, and even rarity of Bitcoin can only be built with time.

## Why do I think Bitcoin has value
### 1. Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies operate on the blockchain.
- Decentralized. Not controlled by a central party such as banks, I have control over whatâ€™s mine, no such thing as freezing bank accounts, taking days to send money across the world, etc.
- Transparent. Transactions are available on the blockchain, use a block explorer (example [here](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)).
- Secure. Uses Proof-of-work consensus algorithm which has proven over the years that it is highly resistant to attacks. The only downside is that it is computationally expensive and requires a lot of energy. Blockchains, in general, do have the risk of the famous 51% attack, but it's [pretty unlikely](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-51-percent-attacks-coin-metrics-research).

### 2. Digital Gold. Great store of value.
The main reason why Bitcoin is $70,000 today.
- Limited supply. Only 21 million Bitcoins are available in our lifetime.
- Deflationary. As time goes by, fewer and fewer Bitcoins will be supplied to the public. This is caused by halving events which cuts the supply of Bitcoin in half every 4 years.

People don't buy gold because it's a medium of exchange, people buy gold because it is a great store of value. If gold does not prove to hold its value, do you think it will still be priced at $2000 today?

Bitcoin is not the perfect option for being a medium of exchange as it doesnâ€™t allow that many TPS (transactions per second). It's only 7 TPS compared to centralized payment networks like VISA which handle thousands of TPS. But this isn't the main point, the main selling point is it stores its value well, and that's **what people care about**.
