I was having lunch with my colleagues today and one of my colleagues pulled out his hardware wallet. We started discussing more about it and he recommended [Trezor Safe 3](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3) over [Ledger products](https://shop.ledger.com/), mainly because of a [massive data breach](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-data-leak-a-simple-mistake-exposed-270k-crypto-wallet-buyers) from Ledger.

After looking it up more, it seems like both Trezor and Ledger had data breaches in the past, but since Ledger had the massive data breach a few years back and it's pricier, I'm leaning more towards Trezor as I'm just starting. 

So, what is a hardware wallet? Let's first talk about ways to store cryptocurrency.

### 1. Store on an exchange
When your cryptocurrency is stored on an exchange, you don't have custody over your crypto. If the exchanges go out of business like FTX, your crypto is gone. Exchanges are also the main targets for hackers to hack your crypto.

### 2. Store on software/hot wallet (like Metamask)
This has its risk as hot wallets are connected to the internet and one could still risk exposing their private keys.

### 3. Hardware/Cold wallet
So to overcome these limitations, one could get a hardware wallet, where your hardware wallet has no internet connection and the private keys are stored offline. This also allows you to self-custody your cryptocurrencies.

There is also a difference between a hardware wallet and a cold wallet. The true definition of a cold wallet is it's solely for sending and receiving assets, while not participating in signing smart contracts etc. To have basically no chance to expose your private keys to the outside world, ensure that your wallet is indeed a "cold wallet" and things should be fine, at least based on my very shallow knowledge as I just did some bare minimum research 30 minutes ago.

That's all for today and I'll share when my hardware wallet comes!
