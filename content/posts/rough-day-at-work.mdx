TLDR, I was really frustrated due to Git issues, specifically related to Git LFS. Basically, whenever you enter a branch, you will get files that are marked as changes, even though you did not make them.

I suspect because these files weren't treated as pointers in my local, so I was having physical copies locally, instead of having pointers to the LFS objects.

This caused me a lot of issues as I had like 5-6 PRs pending and all of them had this issue, this results in some serious merge conflicts.

Skill issue? Most probably. *Definitely asking my team lead about this tomorrow to gain more insights*.

But yeah this was really blocking me and resulted in a lot of friction, ultimately a lot of time was wasted and I didn't get to achieve what I aimed for today, thus the frustration. 

Oh well, skill issue ðŸ¤·, guess we gotta come back stronger tomorrow and fill up the knowledge gap ðŸ’ª.
