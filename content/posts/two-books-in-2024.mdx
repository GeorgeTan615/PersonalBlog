Just two books to read in 2024, how hard can it be? Yes, it shouldn't be hard, which means I have no excuse to not finish them this year. Here are two books that I've recently picked up, one focusing on **money**, and one focusing on **tech**.

## 1. [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194)
Ah, one of the greatest finance books of all time. I'm halfway through this book, but I've stopped reading it ever since I started work at my new company. *Going to continue reading it after I finish today's blog.*

Although it's been some time since I've continued reading it, there's one particular sentence in the book that stayed in my head.
> You're taxed when you earn. You're taxed when you spend. You're taxed when you save. You're taxed when you die.

It doesn't make any sense, you're taxed regardless. Taxes are introduced to punish the rich, but in the end, taxes did not punish the "real rich", because the "real rich" found ways to reduce taxes legally, using corporations, real estate, etc.

Taxes punished the middle-high income people, resulting in the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. Your increase in income does not result in a linear increase in how much you receive.

Looking forward to finishing this book, probably have to refresh the concepts from time to time to know the jizz of stuff.

## 2. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)
A very famous tech book covering a lot of system design-related stuff that would be highly valuable for me as a Software Engineer. 

Haven't started this book yet, but I think it's going to provide a great amount of value to me.
