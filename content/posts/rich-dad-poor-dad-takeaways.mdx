## 1.  Life will push you around, whether you like it or not.
Life is like a roller coaster ride, filled with ups and downs. Acknowledge that pain and hardships are inevitable and required.

## 2. Mind your own business. 
It doesn’t mean you have to start your own company but focus on being active on your asset column and planting seeds to grow it.

## 3. Money “reduces” when you get paid, when you spend, and when you save.
Think about that for a second.

## 4. No one likes losing money. The pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich. 
Robert has never met a rich person who has never lost money, but he has met a lot of poor people that has never lost a dime.

## 5. Don’t criticize, but analyze. Use your mind to see what others can’t with their eyes.
When we see different views, we need to analyze why people think this way and how it is different. Receive things with an open mind and do your own research before you come to conclusions on what's right and what isn't.

Always analyze, never criticize, never assume, and never jump to conclusions.

## 6. Money is made when you buy, not when you sell.
One of my favorite quotes and honestly the thing that has been stuck in my head all this while. We shouldn't be only focused on what we can sell something for, but should also consider what we are buying it for.

Robert gave examples of buying undervalued properties and since they were purchased at a discount, he immediately "profits" off it.

I got some more inspiration from it. The price you pay also reflects the opportunity cost + possible downside. 

Let's say an apple is valued at $9, and you predict that you can sell it for $10 after 5 months. So it's an average return of $1 over 5 months. Most people would say this is a great deal, why not right? But there's something that is neglected in this discussion, **opportunity cost**. You're locking $9 for the next 5 months. What if there's a deal somewhere where you can lock $3 in and get back $1 within a reasonable amount of time? It's a much lower cost.

## 7. Being arrogant means admitting that what you don’t know is not important. 
More often than not, we lose out not because of what we know, but because of what we don’t know. Don’t let arrogance cover your ignorance.

## 8. Pay yourself first, and everyone else last.
As humans, we tend to spend more than we need. If we always pay ourselves first and manage the leftovers for our other spending, we tend to save more. 

Robert goes to a more extreme level where the leftovers are an amount that forces him to figure out more ways to fork out money to cover the spending, without touching his savings + assets.

## 9. Work to learn, not for money. Focus on learning, and learn fast.
Move on if you’re not learning/learned enough in your current position. Purchase books/courses to upscale yourself in areas that you need to work on.
